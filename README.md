# Covid-19 Data Exploration

This case study explores global Covid-19 data, focusing on percentage of infection, death and vaccinations per population, worldwide. This portion of the project is completed in MySQL.

## Project Details

This dataset looks at the number of confirmed deaths due to Covid-19 worldwide. 
### Total Deaths vs. Total Cases
Using MySQL Workbench 8.0, I pulled the total cases of Covid-19 and the total deaths, then calculated the percentage of deaths from Covid-19.

### Likelihood of Dying of Covid in the U.S.

Once I pulled the info on cases and percentage of deaths, I wanted to isolate the percentage of deaths in the U.S.

### Highest Death Counts by Location

To pull the total death count for each location and display the highest death counts, I had to convert "total_deaths" into an integer data type

### Highest Death Count by Country

The previous query included continents with countries, so I filtered out rows that included death counts per continent.

### Global Daily Death Percentage

I pulled the daily new cases and deaths, and calculated the death percentage per day worldwide.

### Global Total Death Percentage

I pulled the total sum of cases and deaths worldwide, and calculated the total global death percentage.

### Running Total of Cases and Deaths per Country

I pulled a running sum total of cases and deaths per country, and calculated the running total national death percentage.

### A New Method - Running Total of Cases and Deaths per Country

I pulled the running sum total of cases, deaths, and death percentage per country using a different method called a Common Table Expression (CTE).
